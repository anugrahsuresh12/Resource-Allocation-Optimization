Key Components
Data Analytics & Visualization

Developed interactive Tableau dashboard capturing doctor utilization metrics, revenue streams by time and service type, and temporal patterns in consultation earnings
Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) examining patient flow patterns, physician workload distribution, and revenue sources across medication, consultations, and laboratory services
Created correlation heatmaps and distribution plots to identify financial impact drivers and service utilization patterns

Predictive Modeling

Built ARIMA time-series forecasting model in Python to predict consultation revenue and identify peak-demand periods
Generated 30-day forward-looking forecasts to support short-term operational planning
Performed time-series decomposition analyzing trend, seasonality, and residual components

Data Management

Cleaned and standardized patient visit data from Kaggle including consultation duration, doctor availability, and timestamped patient progression
Engineered features including consultation duration and post-consultation time metrics
Validated and normalized categorical variables (Doctor Type, Financial Class, Patient Type) ensuring data integrity

Technologies Used

Tableau: Interactive visualization and dashboard development
Python: Statistical analysis, ARIMA modeling, correlation analysis, and predictive analytics
Excel: Data aggregation and summary statistics

Key Findings & Recommendations

Seasonal Staffing Optimization: Increase capacity during high-demand months (February-April), scale down during low-demand periods (June-July, November-December)
Revenue Optimization: Prioritize inventory management for high-revenue medications and increase visibility of underutilized high-performing physicians
Preventive Care Programs: Implement wellness initiatives during historically low-demand months to stabilize revenue and utilize spare capacity
Data-Driven Planning: Maintain baseline staffing with continuous monitoring based on 30-day rolling forecasts
